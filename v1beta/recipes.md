# Recipes

A recipe represents a group of search and refactoring operations that can be applied to an [abstract syntax tree](abstract-syntax-trees.md). A recipe can represent a single, stand-alone operation or be linked together with other recipes to accomplish a larger goal such as a framework migration.

OpenRewrite provides a managed environment for discovering, instantiating and configuring recipes. To implement a search or refactoring operation, a recipe delegates to a [visitor](visitors.md) which handles the AST traversal and manipulation.

## Imperative Recipes

An imperative recipe is built by extending the `org.openrewrite.Recipe` class and injecting configuration properties via its constructor.

Let's look at a simple example where a Java recipe performs an operation to change all references of an original type to a new type.

```java
public class ChangeType extends Recipe {

    private final String oldFullyQualifiedTypeName;
    private final String newFullyQualifiedTypeName;

    //Recipe configuration is injected via the constructor
    @JsonCreator
    public ChangeType(
        @JsonProperty("oldFullyQualifiedTypeName") String oldFullyQualifiedTypeName, 
        @JsonProperty("newFullQualifiedTypeName") String newFullQualifiedTypeName
    ) {
        this.oldFullyQualifiedTypeName = oldFullyQualifiedTypeName;
        this.newFullQualifiedTypeName = newFullQualifiedTypeName;
    }

    @Override
    protected JavaVisitor<ExecutionContext> getVisitor() {
        //Construct an instance of a visitor that will operate over the ASTs.
        return new ChangeTypeVisitor(oldFullyQualifiedTypeName, newFullyQualifiedTypeName);
    }

    //In many cases, the visitor is implemented as a private, inner class. This
    //ensures that the visitor is only used via its managed, configured recipe. 
    private class ChangeTypeVisitor extends JavaVisitor<ExecutionContext> {
        ...
    }

}
```

This recipe accepts two configuration parameters via its constructor. Recipes may be linked together with many other recipes and run in a variety of orders, contexts, and number of cycles. Making your recipes immutable, as this one is, is a strongly recommended best practice. The recipe overrides the `getVisitor()` method and constructs its visitor, passing along any configuration that visitor requires to perform its function.

### Linking Recipes Together

Consider this non-exhaustive list of steps required to migrate a project from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5:

* Replace the annotation`org.junit.Test` with `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`.
* Changing assertions from `org.junit.Assert` to `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`, including updating the order of arguments within the method invocations.
* Removing public visibility from test classes and methods that no longer need to be `public` in JUnit 5
* Modifying the Maven pom.xml to include dependencies on JUnit 5, and remove dependencies on JUnit 4

No one recipe should be responsible for implementing all of these different responsibilities. Instead, each responsibility is handled by its own recipe and those recipes are aggregated together into a single "Migrate JUnit 4 to 5" recipe. The migration recipe has no behavior of its own except to invoke each of the building blocks. Recipes add recipes to the execution pipeline via the `doNext()` method.

In our above example, the "Migrate to JUnit 5" recipe could look similar to the following:

```java
package org.example.testing;

import org.openrewrite.java.ChangeType;

public class JUnit5Migration extends Recipe {

    public JUnit5Migration(boolean addJunit5Dependencies) {
        //Add nested recipes to the execution pipeline via doNext()
        doNext(new ChangeType("org.junit.Test", "org.junit.jupiter.api.Test"));
        doNext(new AssertToAssertions());
        doNext(new RemovePublicTestModifiers());

        //Recipe can be optionally configured to add the JUnit 5 dependencies
        if (addJUnitDependencies) {
            doNext(new AddJUnit5Dependencies());
        }
    }
}
```

Note that this recipe does not have an associated visitor of its own, instead relying on a group of other recipes to achieve the desired result.

## Declarative Recipes

Declarative recipes are defined in YAML and loaded as part of OpenRewrite's managed [Environment](environment.md). A declarative recipe composes and configures other recipes via the OpenRewrite configuration file. In our above example, the declarative version of the "Migrate JUnit 5" recipe might look similar to the following:

```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: org.example.testing.JUnit5Migration
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.ChangeType:
      oldFullyQualifiedTypeName: org.junit.Test
      newFullyQualifiedTypeName: org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
  - org.example.testing.AssertToAssertions
  - org.example.testing.RemovePublicTestModifiers
  - org.example.testing.AddJUnitDependencies
```

## Recipe Configuration & Validation

OpenRewrite provides a managed environment in which a set of recipes are executed. It will instantiate recipe instances and often inject configuration properties that have been defined within configuration files. The Recipe class exposes a `validate()` method that is called by the framework to determine whether all required configuration to a recipe has been supplied. The default implementation of`validate()` provides basic required/optional validation checks if a recipe's fields are annotated with `@NonNull`.

{% hint style="success" %}
The default logic will look for both package level annotations \(NonNullFields\) and field level annotations \(NonNull, Nullable\).
{% endhint %}

In the event that a recipe requires custom validation rules different from the default behavior, a subclass can override `validate()` with an appropriate implementation.

### Recipe Descriptors

OpenRewrite provides facilities for documenting a recipe and its configurable properties via a contract on the Recipe class. A recipe author may document the name \(via `Recipe.getDisplayName`\) and its description \(via `Recipe.getDescription`\) to provide basic information about the recipe. Additionally, OpenRewrite provides an annotation, `org.openrewrite.Option` , that can be applied to the recipe's fields.Collectively, this meta-data is used to build a recipe descriptor and OpenRewrite's managed environment provides a mechanism for listing/discovering these descriptors. The descriptors are leverages to generate automated help with the context of the build plugins and they are also useful when building out reference documentation. The following is an example of how to properly define the meta-data on the recipe so that it is available during discovery and automated help:

```java
public class ChangeType extends Recipe {

    @Option(displayName = "Old fully-qualified type name", description = "Fully-qualified class name of the original type.")
    String oldFullyQualifiedTypeName;

    @Option(displayName = "New fully-qualified type name", description = "Fully-qualified class name of the replacement type, the replacement type can also defined as a primitive.")
    String newFullyQualifiedTypeName;

    @Override
    public String getDisplayName() {
        return "Change type";
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Change a given type to another.";
    }

    ...
}
```

There are a few recommended best practices when defining the help meta-data and following this guidelines will ensure all recipes have similar formatting:

* Initial capitalized names \(only the first word\)
* It is OK to use back ticks \(\`\`\) around terms, think how these might be rendered in Markdown.
* The description should be a complete sentence with a period. 

## Recipe Execution Pipeline

The execution pipeline dictates how a recipe is applied to a set of source files to perform a transformational task. A transformation is initiated by calling a recipe's run\(\) method and passing to it the set of source files that will be passed through the pipeline. The execution pipeline maintains and manages the intermediate state of the source files as they are passed to visitors and nested recipes.

The top level recipe \(the one that initiates the execution pipeline\) and any subsequent recipes that have been chained together will all participate in the execution pipeline. Recipes are composable and therefore, nested steps may contribute additional nested recipes to the pipeline as well.

Each recipe will, in turn, will be executed as a step within the pipeline and step execution consists of the following:

1. A recipe's `validate()` method is called to ensure it has been configured properly. OpenRewrite is not opinionated about how validation errors are handled and by default it will skip a recipe that fails validation. This behavior can be changed by the introduction of an error handler into the pipeline via the execution context.
2. If a recipe has an associated visitor, the recipe will delegate to its associated visitor to process all source files that have been fed to the pipeline. It is this specific stage that concurrency can be introduced to process the source ASTs in parallel.
3. If a recipe has a linked/chained recipe, then execution pipeline initiates a step execution for that recipe and this process repeats until there are no more nested recipes.

Using the same "Migrate JUnit 5" recipe as an example, the flow through the pipeline looks as follows:

![Execution Pipeline for &quot;Migrate JUnit 5&quot;](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2813%29.png)

### Execution Context

The initiation of the execution pipeline requires the creation of an execution context and there are overloaded version of `Recipe.run()` that will implicitly create an execution context if one is not provided. The execution context is a mechanism for sharing state across recipes \(and their underlying visitors\) and the ExecutionContext provided the ability to add and poll messages in a thread-safe manner.

### Recipe Execution Flow

Each recipe that is added to the execution pipeline constitutes a execution step. It is important to understand the flow of

### Execution Cycles

The recipes in the execution pipeline may produce changes that in turn cause another recipe to do further work. As a result, the pipeline may perform multiple passes \(or cycles\) over all the recipes in the pipeline again until either no changes are made in a pass or some maximum number of passes is reached \(by default 3\). This allows a set of nested recipes to be added to the pipeline without requiring explicit ordering or dependencies between them.

As an example, let's assume that two recipes are added to the execution pipeline. The first recipe performs whitespace-formatting to an AST and the second recipe generates additional code that is added to the same AST. If those two recipes are executed in order, the formatting recipe is applied before the second recipe adds its generated code. The execution pipeline detects that changes have been made and executes a second pass through the recipes. During the second pass, the formatting recipe will now properly format the generated code that was added as a result of the first cycle through the execution pipeline.

### Result Set

The successful completion of a recipe's execution pipeline produces a collection of `Result` instances. Each result represents the changes made to a specific source file and provides access to the following information:

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `getBefore()` | The original `SourceFile`, or null if the change represents a new file. |
| `getAfter()` | The modified `SourceFile`, or null if the change represents a file deletion. |
| `getRecipesThatMadeChanges()` | The recipe names that made the changes to the source file. |
| `diff()`/`diff(Path)` | A git-style diff \(with an optional path to relativize file paths in the output\) |
